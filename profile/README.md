atproto OS is an initiative from [@owdproject](https://bsky.app/profile/owdproject.org) focused on combining the web desktop experience with the social capabilities enabled by the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). It empowers users to create windowed and modular digital gardens within a highly customizable desktop environment—personal spaces made of apps, modules, and media content, all connected through the AT Protocol.
